# 👋 Hello there!

I am a **Linux power user** and huge fan of **Arch-based distributions**.  
Currently, I’m running **CachyOS**, which is my favorite distro — fast, lightweight, and fully customizable.

I always prefer **KDE** for its feature richness, flexibility, and amazing apps.  
My favorite code editor is **Kate**, and I enjoy **vibe coding with AI** (I mostly use Claude).  

I use **Zsh** as my shell because it’s extremely customizable and powerful.  
My terminal of choice is **Kitty**, which can display images and is fully configurable.  
I have a solid Kitty config that Is the reason of me using Kitty.

My browser is **Zen**, paired with **DuckDuckGo** for searching.  
I always run **uBlock Origin** and **Dark Reader**, which are indispensable for me.  

I use **Waybar** on my desktop because it looks great and is super easy to configure.  
My display is **2K, 200Hz**, and my specs are **GTX 1660 Super** + **i5-11400k** — yes, not high-end, but enough for a near-power-user experience in Linux.

>The single worst company I have ever seen is microsoft.Full of dogshit 

I am from **Turkey** but have **good English**, and I’m always exploring new Linux tools, dotfiles, and workflows.
